# README

This repo is a collection place for some of my Unity C# scripts. They vary in behaviour and complexity, but they should all work, achieve their goal and be fairly well written. They should all work from Unity version 2020.3.2f1 and forward. This collection mainly contains:
- PCG (procedural content generation), i mainly use it for creating maps
- Movement, different types of player movement
- Immersion, used to give the player a deeper, down to earth feel in the gameworld. Like dynamic weapon- sway, viewbob, screenshake etc.

All scripts are created by me and can be used for personaly.
May not be uploaded and credited by someone else, even if modified
